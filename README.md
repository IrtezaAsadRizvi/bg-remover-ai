# Background Remover (Browser-Only)

This branch preserves two previously unrelated histories:

- `origin/main`: the Background Remover app
- local `main`: the older Local History Lab repository (`activity-log.md` and `stamps/`)

The app files are now present alongside the historical local-history files so both commit graphs remain reachable from `main`.

A fast, private, serverless background remover that runs 100% in the browser. No uploads, no accounts, no tracking - just drop an image and download a transparent PNG.

Built with Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS and powered by ONNX Runtime Web running in a Web Worker for smooth UI performance.

## Highlights

- AI background removal in the browser (ONNX models)
- Private and secure: images never leave your device
- Fast: worker-based inference keeps the UI responsive
- Free: no login, no subscriptions, no limits
- Two models: U^2-Net Human Seg and ISNet General
- Tunable controls: input size, threshold, feather
- Export: instant transparent PNG download

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the app, upload an image, choose a model, and hit `Remove Background`.

## Models (ONNX)

Place your models in the `public/models` folder:

```text
public/models/u2net-human.onnx
public/models/isnet-general.onnx
```

### Model Tips

- U^2-Net Human Seg: best for portraits, people, and hair detail
- ISNet General: best for products, objects, and mixed scenes

These models are large (100-300MB). Expect a one-time download when the browser loads them.

## Controls Explained

- Input Size: higher = more detail but slower
- Threshold: lower = keeps more of the subject, higher = cleaner cutout
- Feather: softens edges for smoother results

## Privacy and Security

This tool is fully serverless:

- No uploads
- No accounts
- No analytics
- No tracking
- No data storage

Everything runs locally in your browser, so your images stay private.

## Performance Notes

- Inference runs inside a Web Worker to avoid blocking the UI.
- `onnxruntime-web` loads WASM assets from `public/ort`.

Required files (copy from `node_modules/onnxruntime-web/dist`):

```text
public/ort/ort-wasm-simd-threaded.mjs
public/ort/ort-wasm-simd-threaded.wasm
public/ort/ort-wasm-simd-threaded.jsep.mjs
public/ort/ort-wasm-simd-threaded.jsep.wasm
public/ort/ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.mjs
public/ort/ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.wasm
```

## Credits

Models are ONNX-compatible segmentation networks. You provide the ONNX files; the app runs them locally with ONNX Runtime Web.
